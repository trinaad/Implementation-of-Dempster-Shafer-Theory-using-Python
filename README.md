Implementation of  Dempster Shafer Theory using Python
Dempster-Shafer Theory using Python
This code implements Dempster-Shafer Theory in Python, a mathematical framework for reasoning under uncertainty.

Requirements
Python 3.x

How to Use
Define the hypotheses and evidence sets in the variables H and E, respectively.
Initialize the mass function m with all hypotheses having belief value 0.0.
Assign the belief values to the relevant hypotheses in m.
Combine the evidence using Dempster's rule of combination.
Calculate the degree of belief for each hypothesis using the final m values.
